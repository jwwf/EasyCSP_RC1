<Class name="EasyCSP.Controller.AccessRule">
<Description><![CDATA[
<p>
Describes a single access rule. Until access is specifically opened in the
controller for a given action, that action is inaccessible to anyone except
the site administrator login. Think of it as sort of a firewall, where one must open
specific ports to specific persons or machines.
</p>

<p>
One rule covers one or more actions. The actions can be specified either as a single
simple string (for example, "index"), a %List ($lb("index","view")) or as a comma-
delimited string ("index,create,update,view"). The second and third arguments,
<variable>users</variable> and <variable>groups</variable>, indicate to whom access
to the listed actions will be granted. If either of these is not stated in the
call, "*" (allow any user) and "*" (allow any group) are assumed. There are a couple
of special symbols for users: "@" for "any logged in user"; and "-" meaning "any
guest user". For example, to allow a controller to grant access to its index and
view pages to any logged-in user (but not to guests) add a rule with ("index,view", "@").
To allow access to those pages to any logged in user who is also at once in the
"accounting" group, add a rule with ("index,view", "@", "accounting").
